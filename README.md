# Goals
* Do exploratory data analysis of Divvy Bikes data in Chicago
* Try to draw a network map between each bike station to see journey flow
* Check journey flow according to time periods - Morning, Afternoon, Evening
* This will give an insight as to when and where people are travelling, which could potentially be very interesting
# To-do

* Try to make origin-destination network map of journeys to and from each bike station
* For each OD pair, make weights based on the number of journeys that take place for that pair
